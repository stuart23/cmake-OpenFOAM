Application
    zipUpMesh

Description
    Reads in a mesh with hanging vertices and zips up the cells to guarantee
    that all polyhedral cells of valid shape are closed.

    Meshes with hanging vertices may occur as a result of split
    hex mesh conversion or integration or coupled math face pairs.
