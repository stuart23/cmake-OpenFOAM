Overview
========
+ Template case for rotating geometry flow with single inlet and outlet
+ Can be used for MRF or AMI simulations
+ Setup to run the simpleFoam solver for MRF, pimpleDyMFoam for AMI
+ The case is designed to be meshed with snappyHexMesh
+ snappyHexMesh is setup to use 3 trisurface files
  + fixed.obj: CAD of the stationary geometry
  + rotating.obj: CAD of the rotating geometry
  + rotatingZone.obj: CAD of surface bounding the rotating region
+ Copy the *.obj files to the constant/triSurface directory
+ The fixed.obj should contain an inlet and outlet region to create the relevant
  patches in the mesh

Meshing
=======
+ Meshing is setup as in the inflowOutflow template
+ See $FOAM_ETC/templates/inflowOutflow/README for details
+ For AMI, the AMI interface can be set up by running createBaffles which uses
  the createBafflesDict file

Initialisation
==============
+ In the field files in the 0 directory, set inlet values
+ For example, in 0/U, set the inlet velocity Uinlet
+ Set the viscosity in constant/transportProperties
+ Rotating properties are set in constant/rotatingZoneProperties
  + For MRF, this file is included from system/fvOptions
  + For AMI, this file is included from constant/dynamicMeshDict
+ Ensure settings are appropriate in controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution, for
  relevant simulation; for AMI, in particular, ensure that deltaT, ddtSchemes
  and relaxationFactors are set for transient simulation
